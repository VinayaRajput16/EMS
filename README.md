## 🎯 Core Philosophy

- **Event-Owned Venues** – Each event has its own unique venue configuration
- **Hierarchical Seating** – Seat categories define pricing tiers (VIP, Regular, etc.)
- **Flexible Ticket Types** – Map ticket types to seat categories with custom pricing
- **Workflow Enforcement** – Events must be fully configured before publishing
- **Data Isolation** – Strict organizer-level access control

---

## ✨ Key Features

### For Organizers
- ✅ Create and manage events
- ✅ Configure custom venues with multiple layout types
- ✅ Define seat categories and ticket types
- ✅ Publish events after validation
- ✅ View analytics and booking data

### For Administrators
- ✅ Platform-level analytics
- ✅ Monitor all events and organizers
- ✅ System-wide reporting

### Technical Highlights
- 🔐 JWT-based authentication
- 🛡️ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- 📊 Real-time validation and error handling
- 🎨 Modular, scalable architecture
- 📱 Responsive UI design

---

## 👥 Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Organizer** | Create events, manage venues, configure seating, define tickets, publish events |
| **Admin** | View analytics, monitor platform activity, access system-wide data |

---

## 🧭 Organizer Workflow

The system enforces a strict step-by-step process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Event] --> B[Create Venue]
    B --> C[Add Seat Categories]
    C --> D[Define Ticket Types]
    D --> E[Publish Event]
    style E fill:#90EE90
```

> **Note:** Publishing is blocked until all requirements are met. Steps cannot be skipped.

**Publishing Requirements:**
- ✓ Venue configured
- ✓ At least one seat category
- ✓ At least one ticket type

**Post-Publishing:**
- Events become **read-only** for configuration
- Booking system is activated
- Orders and seat allocation begin

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Backend Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Node.js + Express** | REST API server |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database |
| **Prisma ORM** | Type-safe database access |
| **JWT** | Authentication & authorization |

### Frontend Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **React (Vite)** | UI framework |
| **React Router** | Client-side routing |
| **Axios** | HTTP client |

### Architecture Pattern

```
Modular Backend Architecture:
├── modules/
│   ├── event/
│   ├── venue/
│   ├── seatCategory/
│   ├── ticket/
│   ├── order/
│   ├── seats/
│   └── analytics/
```

## 🧩 Data Model Overview

### Core Entities

#### 🎪 Event
```
- Title, description, start/end datetime
- Status: DRAFT → PUBLISHED
- Allocation mode: MANUAL | AUTOMATED
- Owns exactly one venue
```

#### 🏛️ Venue (Event-Owned)
```
Layout Types:
├── ROW_COLUMN (theater-style)
├── GALLERY (standing sections)
├── ROUND_TABLE (banquet-style)
└── OPEN_CROWD (festival-style)

Configuration stored as JSON
```

#### 🎫 Seat Category
```
- Belongs to an event
- Defines hierarchy (VIP, Regular, Economy)
- Optional capacity limits
```

#### 💳 Ticket Type
```
- Belongs to an event
- Price-based
- Maps to one or more seat categories
```

#### 📦 Orders & Seats
```
- Activated post-publishing
- Supports manual/automated allocation
- Tracks booking status
```

- **Middleware-driven role enforcement** at the route level
- **Organizers** can only access their own events and data
- **Admins** have read-only access to platform-wide data
- **No cross-organizer data access** – strict isolation
